Bug Tracker App üêû

A Bug Tracker App built to practice real-world defect reporting and tracking, just like QA teams do in professional environments. This project helped me enhance my Software Quality Assurance skills, learn defect lifecycle management, and gain hands-on experience with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
